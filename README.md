### Hello there!  My name is Aaron, also known as Polar Express!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Human Language Technology at the University of Arizona!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on both class projects and some personal coding and video game development.  (I might start using GitHub as my repository for those projects, too!)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have no formal programming experience, but have done basic programming and game development for nearly 20 years!
- - ...I still have a lot to learn, though!  Yet I will give it my all. ðŸ˜„
